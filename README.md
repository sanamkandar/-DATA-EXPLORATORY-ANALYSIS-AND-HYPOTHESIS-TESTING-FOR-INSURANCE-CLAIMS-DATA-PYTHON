#DATA-EXPLORATORY-ANALYSIS-AND-HYPOTHESIS-TESTING-FOR-INSURANCE-CLAIMS-DATA-PYTHON

Description: In this project, I had datasets of insurance claims by customers and did EDA to get insights on what happened in past period, and check inter-relationship between factors.

What I've done:
1. Data manipulation | cleaning - handled missing values, duplicates; categorization & binary encoding.
2. Created summaries:-
i. amount claimed by the customers, 
ii. amount claim based on incident cause,
iii. claimed insurance for driver related issues and causes etc.

3. Data visualization :-
i. Claim amount based on gender and segment
ii. Comparative analysis which gender had claimed the most
iii. Visualize the monthly trend in claims
iv. Compare gender-wise claims of fraudulent claims/non-fraudulent claims

4. Hypothesis testing ( statiscal test) - compared and determined relationship between multiple factors.
i. Any similarity or difference in the amount claimed by males and females / age groups and insurance claims
ii. Any relationship between age category and segment / total number of policy claims and the
claimed amount
iii. Current year has shown a significant rise in claim amounts as compare to last year
